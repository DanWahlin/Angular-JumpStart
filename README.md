# Angular 2 JumpStart with TypeScript

The goal of this jumpstart app is to provide
a simple way to get started with Angular 2 while also showing several key Angular 2 features. The sample
relies on System.js to load TypeScript modules and the required scripts used in the application.

Simply clone the project or download and extract the .zip to get started. Here are a few
screenshots from the app:

## Angular 2 Concepts Covered

* TypeScript version that relies on classes and modules
* Modules are loaded with System.js
* Defining routes (including child routes)
* Using Custom Components
* Using Custom Directives
* Using Custom Pipes
* Defining Properties and Using Events in Components/Directives
* Using the Http object for Ajax calls along with Rx observables
* Working with Utility and Service classes (such as for sorting and Ajax calls)
* Using Angular 2 databinding Syntax [], () and [()]
* Using Angular forms functionality for capturing and validating data

## Running the Application

1. Install `Node.js 6.x` or higher. The server uses ES2015 features so you need Node 6.x or higher!

1. Run `npm install` to install app dependencies

1. Run `npm start` in a separate terminal window to build the TypeScript, watch for changes and launch the web server

1. Go to http://localhost:3000 in your browser
